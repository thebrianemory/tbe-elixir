            But you probably already knew that since you went to my website. You can find me all over @thebrianemory. I am a web developer with giraffe-like qualities currently residing in Los Angeles, CA with my wife and our three kitties Thor, Tony, and Captain (that's right, she let me name them after Avengers). I enjoy bad movies, hard cider, and love pizza. I am a bit of a romantic, a goofball, and a gamer. My lucky number is 13 which sounds odd, but if you ask me how I met my wife it will all make sense (spoiler alert, it involves the number 13).

            While my first love is Ruby on Rails, I have recently taken to learning Elixir. After completing a Udemy course and then putting together my first <%= link "Elixir/Phoenix app", to: "https://github.com/thebrianemory/vidshare", target: "_blank", class: "about-link" %>, I have decided to <%= link "focus solely on Elixir", to: "https://medium.brianemory.com/focusing-on-programming-elixir-a77daab98c05", target: "_blank", class: "about-link" %>. I enjoy writing Elixir, enjoy reading the code, and look forward to doing it in my day-to-day work.

            Programming is a passion and something I really enjoy doing. It feels good to have a passion not only be a career, but something you can do for fun and to help people out. Every day there is more things to learn and more code to write.

            You can read what I am up to on my blog, check out my current projects on GitHub, and connect with me on Twitter and LinkedIn. I look forward to hearing from you!
